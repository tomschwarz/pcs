## Port Forwarding
In some cases, a root process is bound to an internal port, with which it communicates.  
If for some reason, an exploit can't run locally on the target machine, the port can be forwarded using SSH/plink.exe to your local machine.  
The exploit code can then be run on your local machine at whichever port you chose.
